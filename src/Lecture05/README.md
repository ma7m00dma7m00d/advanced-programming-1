### ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Upon completing this exercise, you will be able to:

- Explain _why_ `StringBuilder` is more efficient than standard string concatenation (`+`).

- Understand how `StringBuilder` manages its internal `Capacity` and how it grows dynamically.

- Use key `StringBuilder` methods like `Append`, `Insert`, `Replace`, `Remove`, and `Clear`.

- Use the `Stopwatch` class to measure and compare the performance of different code approaches.

### The Exercise

This exercise is a code study. You are provided with a complete `Program.cs` file that contains detailed comments and live demonstrations. Your task is to run the code, analyze its output, and understand the concepts it illustrates.

### âœ¨ Expected Output

Your console output will demonstrate the capacity logic and performance test results. The times will vary based on your computer's speed, but you should see a clear and significant difference in the performance test.
